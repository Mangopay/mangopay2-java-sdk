[Create a Legal User (Payer)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e259_create-a-legal-user)

[Create a Legal User (Owner)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e1060_create-a-legal-user-owner)

[Update a Legal User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e261_update-a-legal-user)

Please note that changing the LegalPersonType to `PARTNERSHIP` for an existing user will automatically result in:

- A KYC downgrade to Light (default) verification
- The REGISTRATION_PROOF document being flagged as OUT_OF_DATE.

With this new LegalPersonType, the MANGOPAY team can better handle specific legal structures and speed up the validation process.



## [2.26.0] - 2022-12-20
### Added

- The **Deposit** entity has been created

<a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/regulatory#e1061_the-country-authorizations-object">View a country's authorizations</a> <br>
<a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/regulatory#e1061_the-country-authorizations-object">View all countries' authorizations</a>

With these calls, it is possible to check which countries have:

- Blocked user creation
- Blocked bank account creation
- Blocked payout creation

Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/guide/restrictions-by-country">Restrictions by country</a>
article for more information.

## [2.24.0] - 2022-06-29
##Added
**Recurring: €0 deadlines for CIT**

Setting free recurring payment deadlines is now possible for CIT (customer-initiated transactions) with the **FreeCycles** parameter.

The **FreeCycles** parameter allows platforms to define the number of consecutive deadlines that will be free. The following endpoints have been updated to take into account this new parameter:

<a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/payins#e1051_create-a-recurring-payin-registration">Create a Recurring PayIn Registration</a><br>
<a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/payins#e1056_view-a-recurring-payin-registration">View a Recurring PayIn Registration</a><br>

This feature provides new automation capabilities for platforms with offers such as “Get the first month free” or “free trial” subscriptions.

Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.mangopay.com/guide/recurring-payments-introduction">Recurring payments overview</a> documentation for more information.

## [2.23.0] - 2022.05.24
### Added

#### UserCategory management

Users can now be differentiated depending on their MANGOPAY usage.

This is possible with the new UserCategory parameter, whose value can be set to:

- Payer – For users who are only using MANGOPAY to give money to other users (i.e., only pay).
- Owner – For users who are using MANGOPAY to receive funds (and who are therefore required to accept MANGOPAY’s terms and conditions).

Please note that the following parameters become required as soon as the UserCategory is set to “Owner”:
- HeadquartersAddress
- CompanyNumber (if the LegalPersonType is “Business”)
- TermsAndConditionsAccepted.

The documentation of user-related endpoints has been updated and reorganised to take into account the new parameter:

[Create a Natural User (Payer)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e255_create-a-natural-user)
[Create a Natural User (Owner)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e1059_create-natural-user-owner)
[Update a Natural User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e260_update-a-natural-user)
[Create a Legal User (Payer)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e259_create-a-legal-user)
[Create a Legal User (Owner)](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e1060_create-a-legal-user-owner)
[Update a Legal User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e261_update-a-legal-user)
[View a User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e256_view-a-user)
[List all Users](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e257_list-all-users)

Differentiating the platform users results in a smoother user experience for “Payers” as they will have less declarative data to provide.

## [2.22.0] - 2022.05.12
### Added

#### Terms and conditions acceptance parameter

The acceptance of the MANGOPAY terms and conditions by the end user can now be registered via the SDK.

This information can be managed by using the new `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` parameter added to the `User` object.

The following API endpoints have been updated to take into account the new TermsAndConditionsAccepted parameter:

[Create a Natural User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e255_create-a-natural-user)
[Update a Natural User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e260_update-a-natural-user)
[Create a Legal User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e259_create-a-legal-user)
[Update a Legal User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e261_update-a-legal-user)
[View a User](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/users#e256_view-a-user)

Please note that:

- Existing users have to be updated to include the terms and conditions acceptance information.
- Once accepted, the terms and conditions cannot be revoked.

## [2.21.0] - 2022.03.31
### Added

#### Instant payment eligibility check

With the function
`PayOutEligibilityResult checkInstantPayoutEligibility(String idempotencyKey, PayOutEligibility payOutEligibility);`
the destination bank reachability can now be verified prior to making an instant payout. This results in a better user experience, as this preliminary check will allow the platform to propose the instant payout option only to end users whose bank is eligible.

#### Instant payment mode only

Instant Payment requests can now be automatically cancelled when an issue is encountered (rather than falling back to the standard payout mode).

This is possible by using the new `INSTANT_PAYMENT_ONLY` option that has been added to the `PayoutModeRequested` parameter.

You can now add a tag while creating a KYC Document

You can now use this new type of payout with the Java SDK.
